# E-Commerce

## Description

The motivation for this project was to understand how to implement Express.js API, a mySQL database, and use Insomnia for API calls!
I built this project to create an e-commerce back end to understand how I may be able to get, post, delete on certain fields.
The problem that this code solves is being able to connect back end to the whole project, so then data is actually saved and retrieved!
This project gave me even more practice with sequelize and adding ids!
